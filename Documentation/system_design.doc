# TeleMed: System Design Documentation

## Overview
TeleMed is a comprehensive telemedicine platform designed to connect patients, doctors, and administrators through a seamless digital experience. The platform enables appointment booking, patient management, remote consultations, and system administration.

## System Architecture
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (optional: React, Angular).
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js for API development.
- **Database**: MySQL for data storage and management.
- **Hosting**: Deployed using cloud services (e.g., AWS, Azure).

## Database Schema
- **patients**: Stores patient details (name, age, contact, medical history, etc.).
- **doctors**: Stores doctor details (specialization, availability, etc.).
- **appointments**: Manages patient-doctor appointment schedules.
- **admin**: Manages system administrator credentials and roles.
- **messages**: Handles patient-doctor communication logs.
- **prescriptions**: Records prescribed medicines and instructions.

## API Endpoints
### Authentication
- `POST /login`: Authenticate users (patients, doctors, or admin).
- `POST /register`: Register new patients.

### Appointment Management
- `GET /appointments`: Retrieve all appointments for a specific user.
- `POST /appointments`: Book a new appointment.
- `PUT /appointments/:id`: Update appointment status (e.g., confirmed, canceled).

### Doctor Scheduling
- `GET /doctors`: Fetch available doctors and their schedules.

### Prescriptions

- Access medical history.

### Doctor Portal
- Manage schedules and appointments.
- Communicate with patients.

### Admin Dashboard
- System oversight.
- Manage users and platform settings.

## Security Considerations
- Implement JWT-based authentication for secure user sessions.
- Hash passwords using bcrypt for data protection.
- Input validation to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.

## Deployment
- Use Docker containers for scalability.
- CI/CD pipeline for automated builds and deployments.

## Future Enhancements
- Add video consultation capabilities.
- Integrate with external pharmacy services for prescription fulfillment.
- AI-based appointment recommendations based on user preferences.
